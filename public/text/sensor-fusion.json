        "text": "Sensor fusion is the process of combining sensor data or data derived from disparate sources so that the resulting information has less uncertainty than would be possible if these sources were used individually. In our case, GPS provides absolute position information by triangulating signals from satellites. However, GPS data alone can be noisy and less reliable in certain environments, such as urban canyons or indoors, where satellite signals may be weak or obstructed. On the other hand, IMU sensors, which include accelerometers and gyroscopes, provide high-frequency, relative motion data that can fill in the gaps when GPS signals are unreliable. By fusing data from both GPS and IMU, we can achieve continuous and accurate positioning and motion tracking."

        "text": "Several techniques can be employed for sensor fusion, ranging from simple to complex algorithms. The most commonly used methods include Kalman Filtering, Extended Kalman Filtering (EKF), and Particle Filtering. Kalman Filtering is a powerful statistical method that estimates the state of a dynamic system from noisy sensor data. It works by modeling the state of the system and using a series of measurements over time to predict the state and correct it with incoming sensor data. EKF extends this approach to nonlinear systems by linearizing the state and measurement models. Particle Filtering, on the other hand, employs a set of samples (particles) to represent the probability distribution of the system state, which is particularly effective in highly nonlinear or non-Gaussian scenarios. We used a Kalman Filtering algorithm for fusing data from GPS and IMU sensors to achieve more accurate positioning and velocity tracking. "

The state covariance matrix represents the initial guess of the uncertainties in the state, and the transformation matrix helps convert sensor data into the state space.

The residual covariance is then determined to assess the combined uncertainty of the predicted state and the new measurement. The Kalman Gain, which is the optimal weighting factor for incorporating the measurement residual into the state estimate, is computed next. The state vector is adjusted with the measurement residual weighted by the Kalman Gain, resulting in a more accurate state estimate. Finally, the state covariance matrix is updated to reflect the reduced uncertainty after incorporating the new measurement."

        "text":"The next critical step in our sensor fusion process is data synchronisation, essential due to the differing sampling rates of GPS and IMU sensors. GPS sensors usually provide positional updates at 1 Hz (once per second), while IMU sensors can sample accelerations and rotational velocities at frequencies exceeding 100 Hz. This disparity can cause misalignment in the data streams, making it difficult to combine the data effectively for accurate position and velocity estimation. To address this, we employ a technique called upsampling, where we increase the frequency of the GPS data to match that of the IMU data. Upsampling the GPS data involves interpolating additional GPS data points to fill the gaps between the original GPS readings. This process ensures that there is a GPS measurement available for each IMU sample, allowing the Kalman Filter to perform updates more frequently and accurately. By aligning the timestamps of GPS and IMU data, we can improve the temporal coherence of our sensor fusion, leading to smoother and more reliable tracking results. In the upcoming section, we will delve into the details of the GPS upsampling process, exploring various interpolation methods and their implementation within our system."
